My portfolio [website](https://cdeacon.net) that utilizes [Astro](https://astro.build/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

![Preview](./preview/preview.gif)


## Running
Here are commands you can use to run the web server through Astro (for developer use).

```bash
# Clone repository.
git clone https://github.com/gamemann/portfolio

# Change directory.
cd portfolio

# Install packages.
npm install

# Run Astro's dev server available on port 4321 by default.
# NOTE - You can pass --host <address> to listen on specific IP addresses (or all with 0.0.0.0).
npx astro dev
```

If you want to run this application in production, I recommend looking into [Docker](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/docker/).
