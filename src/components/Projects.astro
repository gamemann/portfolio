            A web-sided server browser for the game Team Fortress 2 I made back in 2015/2016 while in High School. The domain used to be browser.tf and fairly active, but was unfortunately lost in mid-2022. As a result, it is now btf.bestservers.io.

            A stateless firewall that utilizes the Linux kernel's XDP hook. The XDP hook allows for very fast network processing on Linux systems. This is great for dropping malicious traffic from a (D)DoS attack. IPv6 is supported with this firewall! I hope this helps network engineers/programmers interested in utilizing XDP!

            A collection of high-performance applications and tools designed for generating and sending network packets. It serves two main purposes: penetration testing, which involves assessing network security by simulating various attacks like Denial of Service (DoS); and network monitoring, which involves analyzing and inspecting network traffic.
